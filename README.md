# Multiple-Linear-Regression-By-The-AI

In the part of learning, I used Linear Regression Class for doing Multiple Linear Regression and predicting dependent variable value.
Also for research purposes, I defined my Linear regression class, which can do Simple and Multiple Linear Regression.
I make it as simple as possible.

   * Content: Prediction of Dataset

#
* Here I took a dataset containing textual data and trained my model from level 0, as the data is testual that dataset also needs Orderd and Nominal(One Hot) Encoding which is also done.
  for this refer,

* dataset: Car Price Prediction Textual Dataset.csv
