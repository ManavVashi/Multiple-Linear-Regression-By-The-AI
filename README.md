# Multiple-Linear-Regression-By-The-AI
Welcome Learners, Here I attached my work on one of the renounced algorithms Multiple Linear Regression.
In the part of learning, I used Linear Regression Class for doing Multiple Linear Regression and predicting dependent variable value.
Also for research purposes, I defined my Linear regression class which can be capable of doing Simple as well as Multiple Linear Regression.
I try to make it as simple as possible.

If you want to see only the applied approach then visit multiple-linear-regression-sci-kit-learn.ipynb notebook
If you want to see how Linear Regression works then you can check linear-regression-code-from-0th-level.ipynb notebook
If you want one complete model-building guide on a data set from level 0 then check used-car-price-prediction.ipynb notebook

Here I took a dataset containing textual data and trained my model from level 0, as the data is testual that dataset also needs Orderd and Nominal(One Hot) Encoding which is also done.
for this refer,
notebook: multiple-linear-regression-textual-data.ipynb
dataset: Car Price Prediction Textual Dataset.csv
