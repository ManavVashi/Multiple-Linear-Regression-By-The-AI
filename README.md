# Multiple-Linear-Regression-By-The-AI
Welcome Learners, Here I attached my work on one of the renounced algorithms Multiple Linear Regression.
In the part of learning, I used Linear Regression Class for doing Multiple Linear Regression and predicting dependent variable value.
Also for research purposes, I defined my Linear regression class which can be capable of doing Simple as well as Multiple Linear Regression.
I try to make it as simple as possible.

If you want to see only the applied approach then visit multiple-linear-regression-sci-kit-learn.ipynb notebook
If you want to see how Linear Regression works then you can check linear-regression-code-from-0th-level.ipynb notebook

Note:- For the task, I didn't use any external dataset, I created a dataset using sci-kit learn.
